# My project
This project is a little library where create some basic data strcutres and they're basic functionality, the data strcutures included in this library are: list, stack and binary search tree.
Though in this data structures you can only have integers, like a list of integers or a stack of integers and so on, so if you wanted to use a list of floats you would eather have to change the code of the
node int in the data structure that you're currently using :)
